			// Here we have a lot of code. This code is mainly adapted from the vanilla code for the reforge option.
			// This code draws "Place an item here" when no item is in the slot and draws the reforge cost and a reforge button when an item is in the slot.
			// This code could possibly be better as different UIElements that are added and removed, but that's not the main point of this example.
			// If you are making a UI, add UIElements in OnInitialize that act on your ItemSlot or other inputs rather than the non-UIElement approach you see below.
